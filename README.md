# ENSEM3A_OpenCLRaytracer
3rd year project : GPU accelerated raytracing engine

This is a retake on my previous project: https://github.com/QuentinHuan/FSCppRaytracer
Last version was more of a prototype and wasn't really usable in practice. The goal here is to make a usable piece of software, with a UI.

Technologies: PyOpenCL, Tkinter
