# ENSEM3A_OpenCLRaytracer
3rd year project : GPU accelerated raytracing engine

This is a retake on my previous project: https://github.com/QuentinHuan/FSCppRaytracer
Last version was more of a prototype and wasn't really usable in practice. The goal here is to make a usable piece of software, with a UI.

Technologies: PyOpenCL, Tkinter

-Diffuse, Glossy and Transparent materials [DONE (but can be improved)]

-BVH acceleration structure [DONE (but can be improved)]

-texture (UV Mapping) [ToDo]

-material system editing in UI [DONE]

-Image based lighting [DONE]
